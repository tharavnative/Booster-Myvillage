Our pharmacists have significant knowledge of nutrition, drug-nutrient interactions and drug-herb interactions – information that most pharmacists cannot provide. We can also advise you about nutrient depletions related to particular drugs, as well as other side effects that can be mitigated by replacing key nutrients in the body that the drug depletes.<\/p>",

While most compounding pharmacies handle drugs, fewer handle nutrition solutions, and only a handful like Village Green have specially trained pharmacists that handle BOTH nutrition and drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Individualized compounds  offer some distinct advantages over mass-produced bottled products, such as:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"std ul\">\n<li>Simplifying a nutritional program<\/li>\n<li>Providing accurate, tailor-made dosages<\/li>\n<li>Reducing the number of capsules needed daily<\/li>\n<li>Giving more options for dosage forms such as liquids, creams, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Elimination of non-natural fillers, binders, dyes and other possible allergens<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
        "left-side-text": "<p>Our compounds are of superior quality, easy to order, and many are covered by insurance plans. A custom compound normally takes 2-4 days to prepare.<\/p>\n<p>Custom compounds are prepared on orders from a nutritionist or physician, like a regular prescription. Some physicians who regularly prescribe individualized compounds include family care doctors, allergists, pediatricians, and dermatologists. <a href=\"https:\/\/myvillagegreen.com\/pages\/healthy-pets\">Veterinarians also use custom compounds for their pet patients.<\/a> <\/p><p>An interesting note: prior to mass production of drugs in the 1960s, most prescriptions required compounding by a druggist or apothecary.<\/p>",
